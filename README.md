##NTAP
This repository contains the code developed by [Sage Bionetworks](www.sagebase.org) to analyze data funded by NTAP. All data resides in the [Syanpse NTAP Data Portal](www.synapse.org/NTAP) and consists of various sub-projects. 

###Plexiform Neurofibroma Cell Culture Analysis
--------------------
Currently we are collating data across the NTAP data portal to create a [pNF Cell Culture](http://www.synapse.org/pNFCellCulture) analysis portal. This will contain all data being generated as part of this effort.
