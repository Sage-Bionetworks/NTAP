This repository contains NTAP-funded analyses required to process the PNF cell lines.

Cell Line Data
--------------
Numerous cell lines have been collected. For a complete description of the cell
lines see:

To date we only have SNP array data for these cell lines, but we are expecting
additional data in the next few months.
